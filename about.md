Open Campus News is a platform for undergraduate data journalism. We publish stories written by college students involving the intersection between reporting and technology.

If you want to increase transparency of universities through technical and reporting experience, join us in employing technology reporting to make campus information open for all. Send a short note along with a writing sample to nicolejavorsky@gmail.com.

Let's hack higher education together!
